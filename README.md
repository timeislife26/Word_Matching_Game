# Word_Matching_Game
The aim of this project was to use c to simulate a matching word game.
A five letter word would be randomly picked from the list of words in the word_list.txt file.
The user would have to enter a five letter word to make a guess. Then the program would tell them the letters that they have guessed correctly and in what position. The user would have six chances to guess the word.
The program would also have to provide a static report of their games.
There is also an option for the user to play a hard mode. This would mean that:
*If the user guess any correct letter, they would have to use it in all future guesses.
*If they guess a letter in the correct position they would have to make all future guesses with that letter in the correct position.
*If they guessed a letter that was incorrect then they cannot guess a word that uses that letter in all future guesses.
